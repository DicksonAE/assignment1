        <h2>BIOGRAPHY</h2>
        <a href=""></a>
        <p>This biography is about Dickson Obeten Enyam which is now Dickson Abeto Eniya due to the reasons that i do
            not know how to spell my name back then and when i was told i spelt it as pronounced to me on the phone call
            by Mr Alex Eselebor and my uncle Mr Solomon Enyam i did not know it is a
            different spelling that is how i used it till i got to 24 years and travelled down to my father’s village
            to visit his grave that was when the relatives told me the names am using is not the correct spelling i wish
            to change it. I was born 14 Feb 1999 in Abacha Barrack Hospital, A Y A Abuja, into the
            family of Late Obeten Enyam. I am from Okporokpana Adun Community Local Government Area of Obubura, Cross
            River State, Nigeria. My father is Late Obeten Enyam from the family of Late Dickson Okporokpana Enyam. I am
            the only child of my father and the first grandchild in my late father’s house. My mother is from Ihumudumu
            community in Ekpoma Esan West, Edo state Nigeria, her name is Mrs RoseObehi Omokhoa Oyaku. She was not
            married to my father and I do not know what happened in their relationship but when I got to remember things
            of my childhood the time I can flash back to I was staying with my aunt which is my mother eldest sister and
            first child of a family of 6 kids her name is Blessing Omokhoa Oyaku now she is Mrs Blessing Eselebor due to
            the fact that she is married to Mr Alex Eselebor from uromi Eco state he treated me like a son and I saw him
            as a father when growing up with my aunt I never ever knew or had any mindset of her being my aunt and her
            husband being my aunt husband I always thought he was my father because there is no treatment that they
            showed their kids that was not shown to me they showed me real love and affection and care and made me feel
            like I have nothing to worry about when it dawned on me that she is not my mother and my aunt husband is not
            my father was when I was about 5 years or 6 years I can not get the actual date and then she said to me that
            my father is coming to see me I was so shocked I said to her my father she said yes then I said ok with
            sadness at heart I felt like an outsider for once in the family because I always thought I was her first son
            because she had 3 kids then all where boys and her first son am just older than him with two months I did
            not even get it clear at my mind back then that there is no way someone can give birth in February and after
            two months being April give birth to another child and growing up in Mararaba Nasarawa State everyone in
            that neighborhood always call me and my cousin brother which I was thinking I was the first child and he his
            the second always this popular name for used in this movie Aki and Pawpaw cause I am choclolate skin in
            complexion and my brother was fair so I am Aki and he his Pawpaw so when she made that statement to me that
            my father was coming to see me I was really shock ever since growing up as a child I know how to bear things
            and I kept my sad feelings inside of me and ask her a question when his he coming so she said anytime soon
            he will come that he wants to come and see me so when a man drove along the street and he came and was
            saying my boy big boy I did not even answer him then my aunt said Dickson see your father I was like Daddy
            good evening cause it was about 6pm or so if I can still remember well it was evening time he came so I
            asked him one question where is mommy then he smiled and held me close to him and said mommy is fine but
            with the mood he was I could detect he his not happy but what do I know as a little child then that was the
            first time I recognized my father face cause all my memories of childhood from 1 months till I got to my
            aunt house is the only thing that I can not remember but when I got to my aunt house I remember things in my
            life I do mot know why so when my father came he bought things for me and my relatives and friends that was
            there at that moment so not long he stayed he left and told me that he will come next time I was like ok
            then immediately it dawned on me that I am not my aunt first son and I am just a nephew to her it was really
            hurt in me and only that gave me a mindset that moment that I am not her child and no matter how she treats
            me she will never prefer her child to me and I am just a stranger in the house and being a stranger I had to
            put myself in my space of a stranger and I was calm but she did not know all this and I was still loved
            without me being her own son and Mr Alex which is her husband never ever one day made me feel like I am not
            his son he loved me the way he loved his kids and I pray that anywhere Mr&Mrs Alex Eselebor are they will
            never be forgotten and God will keep on blessing them more and more in all endeavors of life cause they gave
            me a childhood that was full of fun times and good memories they will always be loved cause they made me
            feel like their own so after that period my aunt called me one day and said that my mother is on the phone
            and she wants to talk to me I said ok I collected the phone I said hell good afternoon mom and she evening
            how are you? Then I answered and said I am fine how are you and how is daddy she said fine then I said ok
            when are you coming she said she will come soon then I said alright if I can remember well I was 7 years old
            that time then one day a white tinted car drove inside along the street and I was playing on that road that
            street direct opposite midland plaza Mararaba Nasarawa State and that street is just adjacent to my aunt
            store then so I was on the street when the car rolled his glass down as a kid seeing my father for the
            second time I was so happy and then he said big boy my boy how are you I said daddy am fine good morning sir
            then he opened his car and said I should come inside that he have sweet for me then I entered and I asked
            him one question I said where is mommy and then he said the same thing like he said the last time that mommy
            is fine then he gave me the sweet I said thank you and I was licking it then he drove away with me and then
            I saw that we are on a different place he took me to his house he was living so comfortable and I said to
            him you stay here alone he said yes he stays alone and I will come and stay with him soon meanwhile all this
            time I am being searched for around in mararaba till the extent my aunt was really sacred and worried
            thinking that something bad have happened to me cause just a minutes I was at the street playing now is been
            hours I have not been seen my cousin brother have not even seen me then a case was being reported that
            Dickson is missing and you know police they will start asking questions and then my aunt called mu mother
            and told her that Dickson have not been seen for hours you need to see the way my aunt told me that my mom
            said it is his father that have come to take him so when I was in my father they just finished dishing food
            for me a call came and my father mood changed and then he said I should not worry soon I will come and stay
            with him I felt really happy I am with my biological father even if is the second time and the food that was
            dished for me that day was amala and soup so as I was eating he said he will soon take me home I said ok
            then when he took me back home he just drove down the street dropped and drove back cause he was really
            angry he came to drop me cause I know definitely that he was not in a good mood cause he his alive and in
            Abuja but rather I am staying with my aunt and my mother is in Port-Harcourt doing a business and my mother
            is not giving him any sign that she wants back in the relationship so after my aunt saw me she was really
            happy cause they all were thinking I have been kidnapped in the neighborhood I came back not happy cause I
            was really happy when I was with my father and seeing where he was staying so comfortable and all I was just
            staying as a relative in my aunt home when I have my Dad so after that day I did not see my father for a
            long time and then he showed up one day and he we spoke he left after 2 years my aunt told me my mom is
            coming from port-harcourt so I was really happy that day but when she showed up a man was standing at her
            back and that man is not my father so when I greeted her and the man greeted me I quickly asked him who are
            you? Then my aunt was like you this boy with question then they all laughed then after they went inside my
            aunt house I know being a kid they think I do not know what was going on I was so angry in me that my father
            is well and alive and then she came here with another man only for me to find out that they came for their
            marriage I was like so shocked then on the day of the wedding everyone was arranging then my aunt said are
            you not going for your mom wedding then I said who will stay in store if we all go I told my aunt don’t
            worry let me stay in store and sell that day I was not happy at all after the wedding and all and they came
            back and incident happened that night between my aunt neighbors and and my mom so my mom angrily said that
            she wants me to follow her to port-harcourt that was how I felt really sad and my father I will not see him
            again for a long time and that time the primary school I attended Rosy Model School I was to represent in
            cowbell mathematics competition and now I could not do any of that so the next day I we started the journey
            it was so hectic and stressful I kept on asking where are we going to and she did not answer then I kept on
            reading the sign post outside the road and I saw where venue then I told her that we are in venue not
            port-harcourt and she said yes we are going to Benue her husband place i was really really sad but what can
            I say as a child nothing then when we arrived there only for the husband people to ask who am I and she said
            I am her brother very funny but sad thing is that she denied me and it was really hurt after staying in
            another man village that is not my father some days after we travelled to port-harcourt going to
            port-harcourt I thought I will start school immediately but I had to stay home till after we lived that area
            which is Rukpakwulusi to Rukpokwu then I was taken to community primary school where I wrote their entrance
            exam and I passed and I was admitted in primary 6B and I the result was 6th the first term and the second
            term I got 3rd and then the third term we wrote the common entrance and I passed I was admitted in Merit
            International School for my junior secondary and senior secondary then first term in ss2 I told my mom I
            want to write waec then I went to Edo state and I stayed with my mom childhood friend her name is Queen she
            was so nice and I was really happy I left port-harcourt then after all the O’level exams I wrote waec neco
            and jamb in Suco International School I passed very well in waec but I had a D in English so I could not use
            my waec for admission and then I used my neco and I wrote postume for Ambrose Alli Univesrsity, college of
            medicine and surgery.
            I gained admission into human physiology 2014, In 100Level I was the Member of House Of Congress the
            legislative arm of my department and then in 200Level I was the assistant secretary general of the executive

            surgery and then in 400Level I still was a member of the house of parliament student union government from
            my department so in school I was called Comr.Hon Dickson Abeto Eniya, I graduated 2019 I was to go for
            clearance then covid-19 outbreak did not make it possible so I had to get that done 2020 after that when my
            result was out I went for my national youth service corp (NYSC) 2021 which I was posted to Taraba I stayed
            in Taraba for 21 days of which I was in Sibre orientation camp Jalingo, Tarawa State which I was the platoon
            9 leader of the nysc and out go ten different activates the platoon I led came out 1st position in 8
            different things and then 2nd and 3rd In the other two activities after camping in Taraba for 21 days I
            relocated to Nasarawa state and after clearance and data collection at Lafia NYSC headquarters I was posted
            to ERCC evangelical Reform Church Of Christ Hospital Alushi Akwanga,Nasarawa State so when I went there
            after going to the school I asked for a place to stay and I went there and then my when I went there they
            said they will need me more at the Evangelical Reform Church of christ college of health sciences so I went
            there I met the provost and he said they need me to lecture physiology and human anatomy I said that is not
            a problem and then I asked is there a place for me to say and they say it is already being used by the
            reverend then I said I can not stay if I do not have a place to stay so I rejected the ERCC and then I went
            on to apply for Alushi Government School as my place of primary assignment so I went there and I became
            friends with the prince of Akun Developmemnt Area and I was offered a place to stay at the palace of akun
            development area I really enjoyed my stay over there and finished my nysc service year August 2022. I am
            currently pursing a career in web development.</p></a>

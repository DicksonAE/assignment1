            <figcaption>Mark Zuckerberg is a technology entrepreneur and one of the co-founders of Facebook, the world's
                largest social networking site. He was born on May 14, 1984, in White Plains, New York, and grew up in
                the nearby town of Dobbs Ferry.
                Zuckerberg attended Harvard University, where he began working on what would eventually become Facebook.
                In 2004, he launched the website with a few of his fellow students, and it quickly became popular on
                college campuses around the country.
                As Facebook's user base expanded, Zuckerberg moved to California and focused on growing the company.
                Under his leadership, Facebook has become one of the most successful and influential technology
                companies in the world, with over two billion monthly active users as of 2021.
                In addition to his work at Facebook, Zuckerberg has also been involved in philanthropy. In 2015, he and
                his wife Priscilla Chan launched the Chan Zuckerberg Initiative, a philanthropic organization focused on
                advancing science, education, and justice.
                Zuckerberg has been named to numerous "most influential" lists, including Time magazine's Person of the
                Year in 2010 and Forbes' list of the world's most powerful people. Despite his success, he has also
                faced criticism and controversy over Facebook's handling of user data and its impact on society.
